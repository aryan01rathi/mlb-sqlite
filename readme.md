# MLB SQLite Project

A beginner-level project where I used **R** and **SQLite** to analyze Major League Baseball (MLB) data.

- Loaded CSV files into a SQLite database using R.
- Created normalized tables and wrote SQL queries to explore the data.
- Learned basics of SQL, RStudio, and working with databases.

Note: `.db` files are not included due to GitHub size limits. Use the R script to recreate them locally.
